# Name Learning App


"A person's name is to him or her the sweetest and most important sound in any language." - Dale Carnegie

This app will help people quickly learn the names of a specific group of people. Potential uses are:
- Learning the names of students in a class
- Learning the names of coworkers at a new office
- Learning the names of other people in a Tech Bootcamp
- Etc.

The app will allow users to upload a set of names, photos, descriptions, and pronunciations. Then, they will be able to quiz themselves with a custom set of flashcards.

Advanced features may include:
- Test yourself just on the cards you get wrong after going through the full set.
- Test yourself on description rather than photo recognition.
- Multiple choice questions.
- Pull names of friends from Facebook groups, LinkedIn or Yale Facebook.
