# First Name Basis

**"A person's name is to him or her the sweetest and most important sound in any language... If you watn to win friends, make it a point to remember them. If you remember my name, you pay me a subtle compliment; you indicate that I have made an impression on you. Remember my name and you add to my feeling of importance."** - Dale Carnegie, *How to Win Friends and Influence People*

**"Call him Voldemort, Harry. Always use the proper name for things. Fear of a name increases fear of the thing itself."** - J.K. Rowling, *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone*

Want to advance your career--or just brighten someone's day? Greeting a person by name isn't just polite. It's a powerful way to solidify relationships. 

This app helps you quickly learn the names of a specific group of people. Potential uses are:
- Learning the names of students in a class

The app will allow users to upload a set of names, photos, descriptions, and pronunciations. Then, they will be able to quiz themselves with a custom set of flashcards. They can also view an entire collection of names to quickly refresh their memory at any time.

Basic features:
- Upload multiple collections of names, photos, descriptions, and pronunciations.
- Quiz by presenting a photo and requiring the user to type in the correct name.
- Review all names and photos in a collection at once for a quick refresher or to find a specific name.

Advanced features may include:
- Provide a hint when you get a name wrong (such as description).
- Test yourself just on the cards you get wrong after going through the full set.

- Multiple choice questions.
- Pull names of friends from Facebook groups, LinkedIn or Yale Facebook.
